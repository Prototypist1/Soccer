I really want players to make tri-angles. I think the way to do this is:
	players like to be a range of distances away from teammates
		this leaves players locked in a lattice
			players defer to other players movements, the ball gets to move as it pleases, the dump defers to the ball, the first cutter defers to the dump + ball, and the final cutter defers to everyone
it would be cool if they knew about bounce shots
	I think I can wrap the ball coordinates when calculating throws

charge up throw, throwing options are effected by your movement

cutting still needs work -- need to consider the other team more. 


cutting isn't right
	- it should be a game of fakes
		- harder to change direction?
	- in a real game it really matters how hard you cut
		- if you are all in, it is hard to change direction
		- some sort of sprint?
	- a small lead grows 
	- different energy speed curve? more linnear?
	- just make it all way faster?
	- a little harder to stop at high speeds?

diving still isn't right
	- the cost of boost is too uninitive
		- boost is free in a radius around your body, if you would leave this radious you spend boost and drag your body behind
			- in that case how does throwing work??
				- I guess you can't pre aim
	- I think the every consumption thing isn't right
		- lots of little expendatures should be okish
			- there is probably some buffer, you don't boost until you are a certain distance youside you your bubble
		- maybe you should slide a bit after boosting

maybe you can charge up throwing?

my AI is still dumb as shit, it should consider different throw lengths and thow throught it's own goal

I want there to be throws a tightly guarded player, with offence only having a tiny lead. both players dive and offense instantly kicks so as not to loose the ball
