just a few small things
	cutters need behind ball 
	goalie needs to stay closer to the goal
	when you have the ball on your end the goalie should not be so close to you
	ball circle, bigger faster, most quantized

I still need to wok on cutting
	with no defence and an idol handler the better should naturally settle in to a circler flow pattern

I need to put an end to two players fighting over who gets to be goaly
	maybe distance to goal should not be the only concern
		maybe a goalie-ripeness evaulator, it could actually just be the gaoly evaluator...

why does it always turn into a clusterfuck?
	lots of shot passes tend to pull the teams into a block
players dive and miss all over the place

team needs to spread out more...
cutters need to not sit some place a wiggle

I really want players to make tri-angles. I think the way to do this is:
	players like to be a range of distances away from teammates
		this leaves players locked in a lattice
			players defer to other players movements, the ball gets to move as it pleases, the dump defers to the ball, the first cutter defers to the dump + ball, and the final cutter defers to everyone
it would be cool if they knew about bounce shots
	I think I can wrap the ball coordinates when calculating throws

charge up throw, throwing options are effected by your movement

cutting still needs work -- need to consider the other team more. 


cutting isn't right
	- it should be a game of fakes
		- harder to change direction?
	- in a real game it really matters how hard you cut
		- if you are all in, it is hard to change direction
		- some sort of sprint?
	- a small lead grows 
	- different energy speed curve? more linnear?
	- just make it all way faster?
	- a little harder to stop at high speeds?

diving still isn't right
	- the cost of boost is too uninitive
		- boost is free in a radius around your body, if you would leave this radious you spend boost and drag your body behind
			- in that case how does throwing work??
				- I guess you can't pre aim
	- I think the every consumption thing isn't right
		- lots of little expendatures should be okish
			- there is probably some buffer, you don't boost until you are a certain distance youside you your bubble
		- maybe you should slide a bit after boosting

maybe you can charge up throwing?

my AI is still dumb as shit, it should consider different throw lengths and thow throught it's own goal

I want there to be throws a tightly guarded player, with offence only having a tiny lead. both players dive and offense instantly kicks so as not to loose the ball
