don't consider throws where the catch is of bounds
don't consider throws that will pass through your own goal
charge up throw, throwing options are effected by your movement

cutting still needs work -- need to consider the other team more. 


cutting isn't right
	- it should be a game of fakes
		- harder to change direction?
	- in a real game it really matters how hard you cut
		- if you are all in, it is hard to change direction
		- some sort of sprint?
	- a small lead grows 
	- different energy speed curve? more linnear?
	- just make it all way faster?
	- a little harder to stop at high speeds?

diving still isn't right
	- the cost of boost is too uninitive
		- boost is free in a radius around your body, if you would leave this radious you spend boost and drag your body behind
			- in that case how does throwing work??
				- I guess you can't pre aim
	- I think the every consumption thing isn't right
		- lots of little expendatures should be okish
			- there is probably some buffer, you don't boost until you are a certain distance youside you your bubble
		- maybe you should slide a bit after boosting

maybe you can charge up throwing?

my AI is still dumb as shit, it should consider different throw lengths and thow throught it's own goal

I want there to be throws a tightly guarded player, with offence only having a tiny lead. both players dive and offense instantly kicks so as not to loose the ball
